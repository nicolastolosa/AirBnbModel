Welcome to the documentation of 'Predicting AirBnb's new users' first destination country'!
==================================================================

This project consists on the development and implementation of a predictive classification model, whose objective is to 
predict the country of destination of the first reservation for new users registered in AirBnb.

By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.

This project includes both the development of the predictive model and its implementation as a python package. 
Below in this page, links to more detailed documentation on both the model building and its implementation can be found. 

.. note::
   **This project has been developed as a part of a Master's thesis, and has no relationship at all with AirBnb itself.** The problem statement and the data, have been provided by AirBnb as a part 
   of a `Kaggle Challenge <https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings>`_ .
